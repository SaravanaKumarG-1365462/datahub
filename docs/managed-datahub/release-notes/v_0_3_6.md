If you are using an older CLI/SDK version, then please upgrade it. This applies for all CLI/SDK usages, if you are using it through your terminal, GitHub Actions, Airflow, in Python SDK somewhere, Java SDK, etc. This is a strong recommendation to upgrade, as we keep on pushing fixes in the CLI, and it helps us support you better.

## Release Changelog
---

- All changes in https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/releases/tag/v0.14.1
    - Note Breaking Changes: https://datahubproject.io/docs/how/updating-datahub/#0141

- Breaking Changes
    - Automatic downgrade to a previous release is not supported. Please reach out to support if required.
    - Metadata tests that are created/edited will not automatically run on a small batch (less than 10,000 assets) immediately anymore, but instead will rely on the scheduled run. Scheduled runs and metadata tests running on asset changes are unimpacted. This bug is fixed in 0.3.6.1.

- Bug Fixes
    - No longer push notifications for soft-deleted entities
    - Fixed a bug in the share modal where sharing was disabled even if instances to share were selected
    - Correctly show the lineage count of upstreams and downstreams when there are large numbers
    - Combine sibling entities in all search lists throughout the app, and not just the main search page

- Product changes
    - Show asset count on home page Domain cards
    - Add the ability to copy an urn from the ML Model asset profile page
    - Added the `deleteStructuredProperty` GraphQL API to delete structured properties
    - Improved "matched" section on search cards to let users know if a column is matched by a search term
    - The "Documentation" button under the "Govern" dropdown has been rebranded to the "Compliance Forms" button to more accurately reflect this feature.
    - On the Compliance Forms page, we now show you an overview of your organization's forms created to help govern your data assets. Here, you'll be able to manage all of your forms from the UI. The previous content of this page still exists under the "Analytics" tab.
    - We have several new question types available for forms - questions to collect documentation, ownership, domains, and glossary terms.
    - You can also now submit a response on up to 10,000 assets in the bulk form submission screen even if you have more than 10,000 assets. You can always submit again once these answers are processed.
    - We now show the bulk form submission screen first when entering a form from the Task Center.
    - We added a search bar in the bulk form submission flow to allow users to search when selecting assets to submit a response for.
